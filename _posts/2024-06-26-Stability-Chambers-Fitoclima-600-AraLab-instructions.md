## Alert system:
 You can connect a communication cable that enables receiving incoming notifications signals from your alarm system however make sure there is someone receiving them.

As the power switch is turned on, a green light will appear on the screen, you must wait a bit and only then can you program the stability chamber.

## Programing: 

![ Main menu ](https://github.com/RachelBober/RachelBober_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/images/Main%20menu.jpg?raw=true)

1. It is mandatory to make sure that the clock of the stability chamber is set, but if it is not, make sure to set according to the instructions in the device's manual.

2. It is recommended to read the detailed instructions for programming in the device's manual on page 39 to 45.

## The following parameters can be adjusted: 

temperature

humidity

illumination

ventilation

gas concentration in ppm.

### How do you program?

On the touch screen: 'stop 1 program'

## Up and down arrows -
you can select 'edit' for editing the desired program and move between the segments.

## Right and left arrows -
secondary screen of the segment, for selecting the parameters within the segment.

## Programming example:
We are working with program #3 

For instance, for one interested in setting a program that will activate 12 hours of light and 12 hours of darkness and will run for two to three months: 

### We will use arrows and set the constant parameters:

Temp - 22 Â°C

humidity - 70%

ventilation - 60% 

It is also possible to determine the concentration of CO2 in ppm

![ set values ](https://github.com/RachelBober/RachelBober_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/images/set%20values.jpg?raw=true)

## Selecting light/dark conditions: 

Illumination - 10% of the illumination capacity

300 minutes - be aware '300 minutes' means that the setting is for 5 hours until dark.

### Change in illumination conditions:

![Program #3](https://github.com/RachelBober/RachelBober_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/images/program%20%233.jpg?raw=true)


![set values](https://github.com/RachelBober/RachelBober_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/images/set%20values.jpg?raw=true)

If a gradual transition from dark to light is desired, then choose 'Ramp' ON

By finishing programming, one must select the number of repetitions in which the program will repeat itself. 

To do this, click on the loop icon and Choose 'Repeat'  

Do not forget to enter a number, for example: 99 - that is, 99 days will pass until the program is stopped.
