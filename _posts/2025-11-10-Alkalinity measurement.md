This protocol is based on Robotic Titrosampler 855 titration system connected to 800 Dosino (Metrohm, Switzerland) including a glass electrode (Metrohm, Switzerland).

## General Comments
Due to the sensitivity of the titrator and the alkalinity measurement and in order to prevent unnecessary malfunctions, the analyses will be performed only during working hours (08:00-16:00) and by prior arrangement, so that another person is present in the room.
*Seawater samples can be stored for several weeks in the refrigerator until measurement.
*Ensure that all samples and buffers are allowed to equilibrate to room temperature prior to use.
- Since you are working with acid. You must wear a lab coat, nitrile gloves always, before starting the experiment. 
-Safety Goggles is optional. 
-Do not bring any food or drink into the laboratory!!!
- Do not touch or use tools, devices and materials not related to alkalinity measurement!!!
- Please maintain order and cleanliness!

16.	Two thin tubes for connecting to the syringe and filter
17.	Permanent marker
18.	110 ml dark glass sampling bottles with plastic screw caps (this volume is enough for 3 replicates)


## Sampling Process 

1.	Rinse the sampling bottle 3 times with the sample water.
2.	After rinsing, sampling will be done by inserting the tube into the bottom of the bottle and releasing the water through the tube in such a way that the water level in the bottle slowly rises. At the end of filling, the sample water should be allowed to flow out of the bottle, remove the tube while the water flows out and close the bottle with a stopper.
3.	The samples should be kept in a cool, shaded place until they reach the laboratory, then the samples should be stored in a refrigerator at 4 degrees Celsius.

##Before starting the experimental procedure
1.	Remove the samples from the refrigerator and wait until they reach room temperature.
2.	Make sure that the waste tank is empty and that at least one third of the DDW water tank is full (the large caps should be left slightly open).
3.	Connect the Disk on key to the keyboard.
Important: Connecting and disconnecting the Disk on key must only be done when the device is turned off, otherwise the software will freeze.
4.	 Turn on the device, the pump and the analytical balance.
5.	 Shake the bottle containing the titrator to mix the HCl.
6.	6. Do not forget to fill the beaker in the Special position with DDW double distilled water and make sure that the water level is high enough.
7.	When the device is turned on, a message will appear regarding the preparation of the burette for work.
8.	Make sure that the Lift is down and the titrant tube (tip) is inside the beaker, so that the HCl is released into the beaker.
9.	Press OK to confirm and continue according to the following details:
10.	MENU-->OK
11.	MANUAL CONTROL-->OK
12.	POSITION LIFT-->OK (the LIFT goes down Below)
13.	Rinsing the piping and burette to remove air bubbles according to the following menu:
14.	MENU-->OK
15.	MANUAL CONTROL-->OK
16.	DOSING Make sure that YES is marked and press OK At this stage, the burette and piping are rinsed. If there is a concern for additional air bubbles, you can repeat the process of emptying and filling the piping with HCl
17.	At the end of the process, manually pump out the HCl liquid that has accumulated in the beaker and rinse using the pump- about a quarter of a beaker
* At any stage, you can go back in the menu by pressing BACK
* Acid calibration/normalization- wear gloves because the standard contains mercuric chloride. 
* For calibration, at least 5 good values for the standard must be obtained and to   determine the acid concentration, a triple value must be calculated.

## Electrode calibration

1.	Calibration must be performed before starting work
Important! Do not expose the electrode to air for more than a few minutes. 
If you take a long break (over 10 minutes) from work, immerse the electrode in undiluted seawater and make sure the level in the beaker is high enough.
Prepare the electrode: Open the cap that closes the hole on the top of the electrode (The filler opening)
2.	Check the level of the electrolyte solution inside the electrode. The electrolyte level should reach 0.5 cm below the hole. If the level is lower, add 3M KCl storage solution.
3.	External rinsing: Rinse the electrode with DDW water and gently absorb the excess with kimwipes without rubbing and move it to its designated place in the titration position.
4.	It is recommended to calibrate the device every 24 hours.
5.	Check the room temperature and change the buffers accordingly.
6.	Fill 3 beakers with buffer solutions: 4.00, 7.00, 9.00 pH and place them on the carousel in positions 1, 2, 3 (from lowest to highest).
7.	Go back to MENU by pressing BACK. In the menu, select:
8.	METHOD-->OK
9.	Select the pH cal method. Make sure that LOAD is marked and press OK to confirm. Ignore the message regarding the changes to make sure YES is marked and press OK again
10.	At this stage, press START and you will receive the following menu:
11.	No samples-->OK -->1 -->accept -->OK
12.	Next sample position -->OK-->1 -->accept -->OK
13.	Sample table -->OK -->off -->OK -->Start Building a table
14.	At this stage, the electrode is calibrated.
When the calibration is complete, the zero pH and slope values will appear on the device screen:


pH[0]                                                7.443
Slope                                               98.3%           
Variance                                          1.729
Calibration temperature (manual) 22.0 ◦C

T [s]	T[◦C]	U [mV]	pH	
140	22.0	198.2	3.994	Buffer 1
87	22.0	25.9	7.012	Buffer 2
37	22.0	91.7-	9.024	Buffer 3


15.	If the slope values are between 96-103% and the gap between pH 3 to pH 7 is 170 mV then the device is ready for samples' measurements.
16.	Remove the cups containing the buffers and close them with the lids.
17.	Prepare the first sample in triplicates.
18.	The buffers will be replaced at least once a month.

## Titration of the samples
1.	Mixing the sample.
2.	Weigh the sample as follows: Place the cup on the scales and zero it.
3.	Aspirate a small amount of the sample using the syringe and tube and rinse the inside of the syringe.
4.	Aspirate approximately 35 ml of the sample again, screw a 45 micron spinner filter onto the syringe and release approximately 33.5 ml (minimum 32.5 ml) into the beaker. Make sure that there are no drops on the side of the beaker and if they have to be collected, these drops will be included in the sample weight but will not participate in the titration.
5. Record the bottle number and sample weight.
6. Weigh 11 samples, as described in sections 1-5 and place them on the carousel in positions 1-11 (according to the recording). Return to the MENU by pressing BACK and using the arrows select:
METHOD  -->OK
Using the arrows, select the desired method, for example: AT1-START-V2 and press OK
Return to the MENU by pressing BACK and using the arrows select:
MENU -->OK
Sample table -->OK
At the bottom of the screen, highlight:
Edit -->OK
METHOD -->OK
Using the arrows, select the desired method, for example: AT1-START-V2 and press OK
ID1-->OK
In ID, type the sample number and press accept
Sample size -->OK
Type the sample weight and press accept
The data for the first sample appears on Line 1 and now the data for the following samples must be added by adding lines using the right arrow and so on.
When all the data has been entered, press Start and you will reach the Sample series
and continue according to the following menu:
No samples --> OK  --> table --> OK --> accept --> OK
Next sample position  --> OK  --> 1  --> accept  --> OK
Sample table  --> OK  --> ON  --> OK  --> Start
At this point, the samples are automatically weighed and the next set can be weighed and the steps repeated.

## At the end of the work:
1.	The electrode's diaphragm must be immersed in the storage solution. The filler opening for the reference or bridge electrolyte must be closed!! 
2.	Use the pump to wash the titration station - electrode, tip, and stirrer and finally pump out the water, wipe the beaker and return the electrode to the test tube containing the preservation liquid.
3.	The sample beaker must be emptied and wiped, and the entire lift assembly (stirrer, tip, etc.) must also be wiped.
4.	Turn off the titrator (long press), the pump and the scales (before turning off the titrator, make sure that the titration station - Lift is down).
5.	To Rinse the syringe and tubes with DDW and allow to dry.
6.	Wipe off any water or salt residue that has accumulated on the scales and the carousel to prevent corrosion.
7.	Empty the waste container.
8.	Keep the work station clean and tidy.

## Troubleshooting and recommendations

## A.	It is recommended to order a calibration from the company once a year.

## B.	Manual pH measurements:
1.	On the computer screen in the lower left panel select MANUAL --> MEASURING INPUT 1
2.	Make sure that the option MEASURED QUANTITY: pH is selected
3.	Fill sample beaker with about 2 envelopes of the desired pH buffer solution (volume should be enough for electrode to be immerse)
4.	Place the glass electrode in the sample tube 
5.	Press START
6.	On screen it will show the pH value that was measure
7.	Write down the pH buffer measurement value.
8.	Wash twice the electrode in DDW and proceed on to measure the second buffer solution and the third.
9.	Wash twice the electrode in DDW.

## C. Electrode treatment (to improve repeatability):
1.	Soak in the supplier's cleaning fluid for about half an hour while stirring and finally rinse with DDW
2.	Soak in a 3M KCl solution: 22.36 g KCl in 100 ml DDW for half an hour while stirring and finally rinse with DDW.
3.	Drain the electrode from the electrolyte and refill.
4.	In extreme cases, the ceramic membrane can be gently scraped with a needle and if all the etch is gone, the electrode should be immersed in a dilute HF solution for a minute and then rinsed thoroughly with DDW
5.	A hydrochloric acid with a higher ionic strength can be prepared and is suitable for titrating seawater samples and improves repeatability.

49.78 g NaCl in 0.5 Liter DDW

Add 0.5 Liter HCl 0.1N


## Formula for calculating alkalinity:

(100,000,000 X acid concentration X acid volume in ml in inflection point)/ Sample weigh in grams
