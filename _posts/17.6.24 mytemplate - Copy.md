This [list](https://github.com/Mass-Lab/Open_Lab_Notebook_Mass_Lab/blob/master/Files/Biomineralization%20Toolkit_2.xlsx) comprehends all biomineralziation-related genes known from literature. The first reference is the one related to the accession number/gene ID, then we put all other references where that specific gene/protein was previously detected/immunolocalized (chronological order).

Stability Chambers- Fitoclima 600 AraLab
  
Israeli supplier: Lumitron
Power switch: top right 
Screen type: Touch Screen
Drainage: make sure the water hose is not kinked and the water drains and collects in a bucket.
Alert system: You can connect a communication cable that enables receiving incoming notifications signals from your alarm system however make sure there is someone receiving them.
As the power switch is turned on, a green light will appear on the screen, you must wait a bit and only then can you program the stability chamber.
Programing: 
1. It is mandatory to make sure that the clock of the stability chamber is set, but if it is not, make sure to set according to the instructions in the device's manual.
2. It is recommended to read the detailed instructions for programming in the device's manual on page 39 to 45.
The following parameters can be adjusted: temperature, humidity, lighting, ventilation, gas concentration in ppm.
How do you program?
On the touch screen: 'stop 1 program'
Up and down arrows - you can select 'edit' for editing the desired program and move between the segments.
Right and left arrows - secondary screen of the segment, for selecting the parameters within the segment.
Programming example: We are working with program #3 
For instance, for one interested in setting a program that will activate 12 hours of light and 12 hours of darkness and will run for two to three months: 
We will use arrows and set the constant parameters: 
Temp - 22 °C
humidity - 70%
ventilation - 60% 
It is also possible to determine the concentration of CO2 in ppm
Selecting light/dark conditions: 
Illumination - 10% of the illumination capacity
300 minutes - be aware '300 minutes' means that the setting is for 5 hours until dark.
Change in lighting conditions:
