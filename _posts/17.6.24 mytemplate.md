This [list](https://github.com/Mass-Lab/Open_Lab_Notebook_Mass_Lab/blob/master/Files/Biomineralization%20Toolkit_2.xlsx) comprehends all biomineralziation-related genes known from literature. The first reference is the one related to the accession number/gene ID, then we put all other references where that specific gene/protein was previously detected/immunolocalized (chronological order).

2024 Cayman samples- Acropora Zoox clade gDNA 6.5.2024


Buffer Preparation:
1.	Buffers pre- heated at 65°C:
a.	Lysis buffer PA1 (ISOLATE II plant DNA kit) 
b.	Elution buffer PG (ISOLATE II plant DNA kit) 

Sample Preparation:

2.	Samples:
a.	ACER Y4 (6/4/2024 Cayman)
b.	ACER OB4 (6/4/2024 Cayman)

3.	Added 0.25 mL of glass beads (0.5mm) and 500 μl of fresh RNA/DNA shield (Zymo) into each empty centrifuge tube.
4.	Took samples out from -20 °C defreeze it in R.T. on the bench.
5.	A piece of 0.25 mm tissue was cut off using a blade razer on aluminum foil
6.	A 0.25 mm tissue and about 500 μl of sample in RNA/DNA shield added into the centrifuge tube with beads and fresh RNA/DNA shield.
7.	Vortexed at max speed for 2 minutes.
8.	Removed 400 μl of the supernatant and transfer to 3 new centrifuge tubes for each sample.
9.	Centrifuged at 9000 rcf for 3 minutes.
10.	Transferred 300 μl supernatant to a new centrifuge tube and discarded the pellet.
11.	Added 30 μl of Proteinase K digestion buffer (10:1 ratio of sample:digestion buffer), and 15 μl of Proteinase K (2:1 ratio of digestion buffer:Proteinase K) to each sample.
12.	Vortexed and spin down.
13.	Incubated for 30 minutes at 60°C
14.	Vortexed at max speed for 2 minutes.
 
Continued with ISOLATE II plant DNA kit- gDNA extraction protocol:
 
15.	Transferred 350 μl supernatant to a new centrifuge tube and discarded the pellet.
16.	Added 400 μl of pre-heated lysis buffer PA1 
17.	Incubated for 25 minutes at 65°C
18.	Added 700ul of the liquid to purple spin columns and collection tubes
19.	Centrifuged 11,000 rcf for 2 minutes
20.	Saved the flow through in new 2mL tubes
21.	Repeated addition, centrifugation, and saving of flowthrough for the remaining amount of liquid (2-3 total spins)
22.	Added 450 μl binding buffer PB to the flow through in new 2mL tubes 
23.	Pipetted ups and downs for 5 times to mix 
24.	Transferred 700 μl of the liquid to green spin columns and collection tubes
25.	Centrifuged 11,000 rcf for 1 minute
26.	Discarded flow through (Zymo kit waste)
27.	Repeated addition, centrifugation, and discarding of flowthrough for the remaining amount of liquid.
28.	Added 400 μl wash buffer PAW1 to the green spin columns
29.	Centrifuged 11,000 rcf for 1 minute
30.	Discarded flow through (Zymo kit waste)
31.	Added 700 μl wash buffer PAW2 to the green spin columns
32.	Centrifuged 11,000 rcf for 1 minute
33.	Discarded flow through (Zymo kit waste)
34.	Added 200 μl wash buffer PAW2 to the green spin columns
35.	Centrifuged 11,000 rcf for 2 minutes
36.	Discarded flow through (Zymo kit waste)
37.	Transferred spin columns to new 1.5mL tubes for each sample labeled as final DNA tubes
38.	Discarded flow through and collection tubes
39.	Added 50ul warmed Elution buffer PG to the spin columns gently by dripping over the filter
40.	Incubated at 65°C for 5 minutes
41.	Centrifuged 11,000 rcf for 1 minutes
42.	Added another 50ul warmed Elution buffer PG to the spin columns gently by dripping over the filter
43.	Incubated at 65°C for 5 minutes
44.	Centrifuged 11,000 rcf for 1 minutes
45.	Discarded the spin columns
46.	Made strip tubes with 7ul of each sample in them for QC
47.	Kept tubes on ice bucket then stored in -20 degree freezer
